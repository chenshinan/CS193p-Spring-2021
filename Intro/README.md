- hope this section helps if you're thinking about taking CS193p
- btw, the course and Professor Hegarty is amazingüëè

## # My programming background when I dived into this course
- knew C and Python and could do really basic programming but not that proficient in neither
- did not major Computer Science in college
- knew basic algorithm and data structure
  - just enough to take coding tests for jobs
- definitelty not familiar with OOP(read a book about it, but literally no experience)
- learned basic Swift from [100days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) just before taking this course  
  - but only completed the language part(upto day 15?)

## # How long it took and how I studied
- this is just to SHARE my experience, this is NOT the best way or anything
- I think it took me about 8 ~ 10 weeks, studided 6-8 hours probably at least 5 days a week
- Listened to the lecture(multiple times if needed) -> re-did the lecture codes by myself -> organinzed what I learned on my blog -> did the assignment -> organized what I learned again on the blog
- for me, animations were the first bump and multithreading was also tough but watching the lecture over and over again helped(not sure though 'cause it's still tough ü§£)
